abstract: >
 High assurance systems have been defined as systems &ldquo;you would bet your
 life on.&rdquo; This article discusses the application of a form of functional
 programming&mdash;what we call &ldquo;monadic programming&rdquo;&mdash;to the
 generation of high assurance and secure systems. Monadic programming languages
 leverage algebraic structures from denotational semantics and functional
 programming&mdash;monads&mdash;as a flexible, modular organizing principle for
 secure system design and implementation. Monadic programming languages are
 domain-specific functional languages that are both sufficiently expressive to
 express essential system behaviors and semantically straightforward to support
 formal verification.
