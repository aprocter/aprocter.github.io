 Asynchronous interrupts abound in computing systems, yet they remain a thorny
 concept for both programming and verification practice. The ubiquity of
 interrupts underscores the importance of developing programming models to aid
 the development and verification of interrupt-driven programs. The research
 reported here recognizes asynchronous interrupts as a computational effect and
 encapsulates them as a building block in modular monadic semantics. The
 resulting modular semantic model can serve as both a guide for functional
 programming with interrupts and as a formal basis for reasoning about
 interrupt-driven computation as well.
