 The functional programming community has developed a number of powerful
 abstractions for dealing with diverse programming models in a modular way.
 Beginning with a core of pure, side effect free computation, modular monadic
 semantics (MMS) allows designers to construct domain-specific languages by
 adding layers of semantic features, such as mutable state and I/O, in an
 &agrave; la carte fashion. In the realm of interpreter and compiler
 construction, the benefits of this approach are manifold and well explored.
 This paper advocates bringing the tools of MMS to bear on hardware design and
 verification. In particular, we shall discuss a prototype compiler called
 ReWire which translates high-level MMS hardware specifications into working
 circuits on FPGAs. This enables designers to tackle the complexity of hardware
 design in a modular way, without compromising efficiency.
