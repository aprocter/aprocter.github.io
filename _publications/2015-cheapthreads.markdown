abstract: >
  This article demonstrates how a powerful and expressive abstraction from
  concurrency theory plays a dual r&ocirc;le as a programming tool for concurrent
  applications and as a foundation for their verification. This
  abstraction&mdash;monads of resumptions expressed using monad
  transformers&mdash;is <em>cheap</em>: it is easy to understand, easy to implement,
  and easy to reason about. We illustrate the expressiveness of the
  resumption monad with the construction of an exemplary multitasking
  operating system kernel with process forking, preemption, message passing,
  and synchronization constructs in the pure functional programming language
  Haskell.
