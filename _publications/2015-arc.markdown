 Although FPGAs have the potential to bring software-like flexibility and
 agility to the hardware world, designing for FPGAs remains a difficult task
 divorced from standard software engineering norms. A better programming flow
 would go far towards realizing the potential of widely deployed, programmable
 hardware. We propose a general methodology based on domain specific languages
 embedded in the functional language Haskell to bridge the gap between high
 level abstractions that support programmer productivity and the need for high
 performance in FPGA circuit implementations. We illustrate this methodology
 with a framework for regular expression to hardware compilers, written in
 Haskell, that supports high programmer productivity while producing circuits
 whose performance matches and, indeed, exceeds that of a state of the art,
 hand-optimized VHDL-based tool. For example, after applying a novel
 optimization pass, throughput increased an average of 28.3% over the state
 of the art tool for one set of benchmarks. All
