 Monads as an organizing principle for programming and semantics are
 notoriously difficult to grasp, yet they are a central and powerful
 abstraction in Haskell. This paper introduces a domain-specific language,
 MonadLab, that simplifies the construction of monads, and describes its
 implementation in Template Haskell. MonadLab makes monad construction truly
 first class, meaning that arcane theoretical issues with respect to monad
 transformers are completely hidden from the programmer. The motivation behind
 the design of MonadLab is to make monadic programming in Haskell simpler while
 providing a tool for non-Haskell experts that will assist them in
 understanding this powerful abstraction.
