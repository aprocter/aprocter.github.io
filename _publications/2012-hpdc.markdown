abstract: >
 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are increasingly becoming part of HPC
 clusters. Nevertheless, cloud computing services and resource management
 frameworks targeting heterogeneous clusters including GPUs are still in their
 infancy. Further, GPU software stacks (e.g., CUDA driver and runtime)
 currently provide very limited support to concurrency.
 <br /><br />
 In this paper, we propose a runtime system that provides abstraction and
 sharing of GPUs, while allowing isolation of concurrent applications. A
 central component of our runtime is a memory manager that provides a virtual
 memory abstraction to the applications. Our runtime is flexible in terms of
 scheduling policies, and allows dynamic (as opposed to programmer-defined)
 binding of applications to GPUs. In addition, our framework supports dynamic
 load balancing, dynamic upgrade and downgrade of GPUs, and is resilient to
 their failures. Our runtime can be deployed in combination with VM-based cloud
 computing services to allow virtualization of heterogeneous clusters, or in
 combination with HPC cluster resource managers to form an integrated resource
 management infrastructure for heterogeneous clusters. Experiments conducted on
 a three-node cluster show that our GPU sharing scheme allows up to a 28% and a
 50% performance improvement over serialized execution on short- and
 long-running jobs, respectively. Further, dynamic inter-node load balancing
 leads to an additional 18-20% performance benefit.
