abstract: >
 There is no such thing as high assurance without high assurance hardware. High
 assurance hardware is essential, because any and all high assurance systems
 ultimately depend on hardware that conforms to, and does not undermine,
 critical system properties and invariants. And yet, high assurance hardware
 development is stymied by the conceptual gap between formal methods and
 hardware description languages used by engineers. This paper presents ReWire,
 a functional programming language providing a suitable foundation for formal
 verification of hardware designs, and a compiler for that language that
 translates high-level, semantics-driven designs directly into working hardware.
 ReWire's design and implementation are presented, along with a case study in
 the design of a secure multicore processor, demonstrating both ReWire's
 expressiveness as a programming language and its power as a framework for
 formal, high-level reasoning about hardware systems.
