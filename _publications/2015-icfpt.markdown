 There is a semantic gap between the hardware definition languages used to
 design and implement hardware and the languages and logics used to formally
 specify and verify them. Bridging this gap&mdash;i.e., constructing formal models
 from existing hardware artifacts&mdash;can be costly, time-consuming, and error
 prone&mdash;and yet utterly necessary if formal verification is to proceed. This
 work demonstrates that this gap can be collapsed by starting in a pure
 functional language that is also a hardware description language, and that
 equational style verifications may be performed directly on the source text of
 a hardware design, thereby significantly lowering the verification cost for
 reconfigurable designs. When combined with an efficient compiler, this
 methodology achieves both good performance and low cost verification.
