 Recent research has shown how the formal modeling of concurrent systems can
 benefit from monadic structuring. With this approach, a formal system model is
 really a program in a domain specific language defined by a monad for
 shared-state concurrency. Can these models be compiled into efficient
 implementations? This paper addresses this question and presents an overview
 of techniques for compiling monadic concurrency models directly into
 reasonably efficient software and hardware implementations. The implementation
 techniques described in this article form the basis of a semantics-directed
 approach to model-driven engineering.
