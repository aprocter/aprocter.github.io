 In this paper, we establish a semantic foundation for the safe execution of
 untrusted code. Our approach extends Moggi’s computational λ-calculus in two
 dimensions with operations for asynchronous concurrency, shared state and
 software faults and with an effect type system &agrave; la Wadler providing
 fine-grained control of effects. An equational system for fault isolation is
 exhibited and its soundness demonstrated with a semantics based on monad
 transformers. Our formalization of the equational system in the Coq theorem
 prover is discussed. We argue that the approach may be generalized to capture
 other safety properties, including information flow security.
