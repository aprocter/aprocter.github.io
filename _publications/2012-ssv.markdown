 We extend an off-the-shelf, executable formal semantics of C (Ellison and
 Ro»ôu's &#x1d542; Framework semantics) with the core features of CUDA-C. The hybrid
 CPU/GPU computation model of CUDA-C presents challenges not just for
 programmers, but also for practitioners of formal methods. Our formal
 semantics helps expose and clarify these issues. We demonstrate the usefulness
 of our semantics by generating a tool from it capable of detecting some race
 conditions and deadlocks in CUDA-C programs. We discuss limitations of our
 model and argue that its extensibility can easily enable a wider range of
 verification tasks.
