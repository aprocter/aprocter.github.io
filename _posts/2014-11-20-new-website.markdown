Well, having recently gotten the dissertation monkey off my back, I figured I had time for a long-overdue website refresh. <!--more--> I've given up WordPress in favor of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Still have a lot more material to update, but I'm liking the basic framework so far, and not having to maintain my own VPS is nice. Basically I'm just writing this post so the front page doesn't look so empty. :)
